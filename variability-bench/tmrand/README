This directory has code for a "tiny" variant of the Mersenne
twister random-number generator :

http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/TINYMT/

I packaged that into a routine that returns an array of random
doubles 0.0 <= rand < 1.0.

for systems with 64-bit "long" types :

void TMrand(unsigned long seed, int npts, double * xrand);

add extern "C" qualifier for use in C++.  Typical use :

unsigned long seed = 13579UL;
int npts = 1000;
double * xrand = (double *) malloc(npts*sizeof(double));
TMrand(seed, npts, xrand);
...

To use, just add the proper declaration of tmrand() and link
with libtmrand.a.

There is an example in this directory : main.x .

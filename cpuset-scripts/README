Cpuset scripts can be used to set up cpusets in order to run with CPU isolation.
This scripts are to be used standalone in a cluster where the user has sudo priviledges.
Usage:

1) Create cpusets and move all the movable tasks to the system cpuset:

 $./cpuset_init
    
2) Execute cpuset_user_run to run your application in the user cpuset:

 $./cpuset_user_run <binary> <arguments>

If this is an mpi job cpuset scripts need to be avaialable on each node
and can be used as follows:
 
 $ mpirun <mpi parameters>  ./cpuset_user_run <mpi binary> <arguments>

3) Remove cpusets:
 
 $./cpuset_close


Additional scripts provided:
 cpuset_move - moves tasks between 2 cpusets
 cpuset_info - prints the status of cpusets
 cpuset_run - runs a binary in a given cpuset
